Objective:

- To analyze and model employee turnover using advanced data analysis techniques and machine learning models to gain actionable insights.

Process:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Visualized attrition trends across departments, salary levels, and employee satisfaction.
- Filled missing values using statistical imputation (mean/method-specific).
- Segregated data into numerical and categorical variables for analysis.
- Identified key trends:
  - High attrition rates for low satisfaction levels.
  - Longer working hours correlated with higher attrition in certain departments.
  - Employees with fewer promotions showed higher turnover rates.

2. Feature Analysis:

- Applied Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to identify multicollinearity among predictors.
- Used heatmaps to explore correlations, finding significant relationships:
- Satisfaction level (-0.39) strongly correlated with attrition.
- Weak correlations with variables like work accidents and tenure.

3. Modeling:

- Employed machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, KNN).
- Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy and classification reports.
- Identified significant predictors like satisfaction level, average monthly hours, and salary levels.

4. Visualization:

- Created compelling visualizations (bar plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps) to support findings.
- Highlighted:
  - Departments with the highest turnover.
  - The relationship between satisfaction levels and attrition across project workloads and tenure.

5. Findings:

- Dissatisfaction is the primary driver of employee attrition, especially in the 3rd and 4th years of employment.
- Employees with lower salaries and higher workloads are more likely to leave.
- Career advancement opportunities (e.g., promotions) play a significant role in retention.

Outcome:
This project provides actionable insights for HR teams to design targeted retention strategies, focusing on employee satisfaction, workload distribution, and career growth opportunities.
